## Python Tic-Tac-Toe

## Simple Tic-Tac-Toe IA using Min-Max algorithm

## TODO:
- Improve UI
- Improve interaction (has errors)

### Sample Usage
```python3
O - -
- X -
- - -
```
User Input
```
0 2
```
That means `row 0` `column 2` (0-based array)

```python3
O - X
- X -
- - -
```

The IA plays automatically after the player

### Just a remainder: You can't beat IA :). Have Fun
